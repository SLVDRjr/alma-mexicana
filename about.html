                <h1>The Story of Alma Mexicana</h1>
                <p>
                  The story of Alma Mexicana reflects the quintessential
                  American dream: having a vision and investing the long hours
                  necessary to build a successful business. The work in a
                  restaurant is never ending, and although they have relatives
                  and some staff to help out, you’ll find Enrique or Alma at
                  Alma Mexicana pretty much from opening until closing.

                  <h2>The trail to Nashua</h2>
                  <p>
                    As a young man, Enrique picked apples, cherries, and onions
                    in the Pacific Northwest. His father cooked in a Mexican
                    restaurant in California, which gave Enrique his first view
                    of restaurant life. At 19, he traded the fields for the
                    kitchen. When his family moved to Texas, Enrique cooked at
                    his father’s side, first at his uncle’s restaurant and then
                    at various chains, including Chili’s, the Olive Garden, and
                    the Black-Eyed Pea. Being a restaurateur must have run in
                    Enrique’s family, as his uncle owned two Mexican food
                    restaurants, Tino’s Cantina and Tino’s Too, in Plano, Texas.
                    Alma started making tortillas when she was just eight and
                    living in Colima. She learned the skill from her mother,
                    using only her hands to mix the dough of maize flour and
                    water. She would pat little round cakes and press them flat
                    using a wooden tortilla maker. Alma and Enrique moved to
                    Nashua shortly after getting married. Enrique had been
                    living in Plano, and Alma moved straight from Mexico —
                    trading a tropical climate for New England’s winters. She
                    says the cold doesn’t bother her, but she doesn’t like
                    driving in the snow.

                  <h2>Roots in Colima</h2>
                  <p>
                    Both Enrique and Alma were born near the Pacific Ocean in
                    the state of Colima, Mexico. Colima lies between Puerto
                    Vallarta and Acapulco. One of Mexico’s smaller states, it is
                    larger than Rhode Island and smaller than Delaware. Nearly
                    600,000 people call Colima home. Volcanoes are the most
                    prominent landscape feature, including two peaks that tower
                    about 14,000 feet above the ocean. The taller and older of
                    the two, Nevado de Colima, is inactive. The younger, Volcán
                    de Colima, is Mexico’s most active volcano, erupting 40
                    times since 1576, most recently in 2008. Wikipedia has a
                    great article on the Colima volcanoes, if you’re interested
                    in learning more. From the warm ambiance to the family-style
                    service, you can’t beat Alma Mexicana for your next night
                    out!
